        <p><h1>I overfed my child because I wanted him to become big chungus. AITA?</h1>

            So my (M420) son (M69) still lives in my house because I'm forcing him too. 
            Lately I've been coding his food in a substance that makes him gain twice the amount of weight. 
            I simply want him to look like my idol and father figure Big Chungus. 
            It is also punishment for catching him without wearing a fedora and even texting emojis to his friends! 
            I feel like if anything I'm going a little easy on him but idk. 
            He called me TA because it is unhealthy but I'm doing it for a good cause. 
            I'm sure you all agree that turning my son into big chungus is wholesome. 
            But with that being said, AITA?</p>
